    <td>I used the hint a lot, which is usually very useful, as it gives you a hint (hence its name) about what the code is meant to look like, without giving it totally away. Then, something else I was finding useful was the get code button. This can be misused, and just used to give you the code by just spamming the run button. However I used this button only when I could not work it out or no one could help me. In fact I clicked the No Way button more than the get ode button.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was persevering a little too much when getting the answer was the better option. For example I refrained from asking my partner, because I thought I could work the code out, when actually asking would have been better. Having said this, I need to persevere when it is the most efficient.
