    <td>I found that when I was putting lights into the holes, looking carefully at the diagrams so I could put the lights in the right place first time. This helped because it was hard to put the lights in, so putting it in the wrong place wasted time. I also found that holding the bottom end of the wire and then phishing it in one end at a time worked. I checked the colours of the resistors before putting them in. The book's code being wrong did didn’t help but we did find out the correct code from another group. They had worked it out through trial and error. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was not getting my teammates to read out where the lights, fuses and wires to go. This meant that my work was slow because i had to try and work out where the components had to go on my own which slowed me down. I need to get my partner to help. I also need to stop getting distracted when my partner is doing work, instead try to help and if I can’t then watch what he is doing not just leaving him to do it on his own.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Won’t go around the whole room talking to people when it is not my turn to plug lights in or write code.
I will try to speed up my putting lights in, as it took me a very long time.
Make sure I swap who is doing what regularly.</td>
