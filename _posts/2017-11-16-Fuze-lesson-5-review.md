    <td>I couldn't plug my fuze box in, but trying to get it to work, but effective strategies included, trying a different computer, trying a different fuze box, trying a different power cable and trying different HDMI’s. Sadly none of this worked, so in the end, we joined a group that were on the LED’s and programming them to flash. I learned by mainly reading the book, but I got quite a bit of help from others.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to not go straight to someone who knows how to do whatever I am doing, but ask myself then my partner, then someone who might know in the class and only then do I go to the teacher. I also need to stop getting distracted, by staying at my place and persevering, I won’t get distracted. Also swapping more frequently as the blocks of code get bigger.
