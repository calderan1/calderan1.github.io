    <td>In this lesson, the whole class was learning about ascii characters. This is short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Basically what those alphabet if you like oes, is takes the whole keyboard, and its character and numbers them. this allows you to convert them into binary and. There is one problem with this though: when you are then putting the binary values into a long string, not every number will be in 8 bit.

The problem with the numbers not being in 8 Bit, is that it is not really full binary. The computer has to have the binary on 8 bit for it to use the ascii characters. You can however use the right function, and then how many bits you want your binary number in. For this, you would put =.........right(concat("00000",C3,8)). This would add the 0's at the start of the number, until it is in 8 Bit. 

Throughout the lesson, we sat and listened and tried to understand the concept of ascii characters. We understood that the Caesar cypher that we developed was an introduction to the binary and ascii characters. we discussed how binary works. The obvious example of binary is in computers. We had conversations about old computers, processors, but most importantly pixels. we discussed hoe they could either be on or off, and show a colour of, at first, a very limited range of numbered colours. the bit numbers are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128â€¦ and so on. but eventually, we got onto building/ coding our encrypters.
