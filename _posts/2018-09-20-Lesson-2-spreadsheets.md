    <td>This lesson, we were taught how to use the CONCATENATE function. This the function that will basically take the separated letters in separate cells into one single cell. This could be useful to and what we used it for, is gathering a group of encoded letters and spitting out your encoded message. You can also use it for grouping decoded letters. But these aren't the only uses. The way you use the CONCATENATE function is similar to the way you use VLOOKUP, at least in the way that you reference the cells you want to CONCATENATE, and the columns that you want to select to VLOOKUP.

Later in the lesson we were gone a challenge to use VLOOKUP to convert our message into binary (with 1’s and 0’s) and then try to work out how to decode it. I have to say I was struggling a little to do letters to letters and back to letters, so putting letters into binary and back again was considerably harder. 

 When I was trying this challenge, I did not persevere very well, as I sort of just gave up, as we were close to the end of the lesson. However I did try at the end, to ask around how others had done it.</td>
