    <td>Seeing as it was our first time using Fuze, me and my partner were having difficulties at first even plugging in the fuze box in. 

Once we had done that, we had to rush the first part of 1.1. We managed to complete the part of 1.1 when you turn the writing a colour that you want to. 

We found that having one of us reading out of the book and one of us typing, was quickest way to get through. 

The next lesson we did the same with the variables and the questions about name, age, hobby and colour .</td>

    <td>I let my partner do all of the typing at one point, and to learn, you really need to do both to properly learn. I also need to stop scooting around on the chairs and help my partner.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to stop getting distracted and keep on  helping my partner, as that is the quickest way to work: with one person reading, one person typing.</td>
