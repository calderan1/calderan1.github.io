    <td>It the first lesson of learning how to use spreadsheets, we learned all about encoding and decoding messages (and how it was invented by Caesar to stop messages being read by people who intercepted runners),. We learned how his simple method of encoding a message can be used to encrypt messages nowadays for example in transactions online, where you would give your bank details and they would be encrypted, then the bank would get a way to encode it to stop people intercepting important information. 

After we had listened to what encoding was, we moved making our own spreadsheets and learning how to encode and decode words such as 'hello world', using the cell, tables and referencing. 

We made two lists, A-Z, but the second was offset, so that A (from the first list) lined up with C (form the second list), and so on. We then used all of the rest of the columns to decode the messages we put in the different cells. We used the ‘algebra’ that you put in the cells so that they would reference the first two columns. I thought this was really clever and was just the surface of all of the possibilities like Mr Tansley's report writing spreadsheet! </td>
