    <td>I didn't manage to get my own FUZE box working, so I joined another group after about 20 minutes of trying to get our own FUZE box to work.  We joined a group that were already coding the lights, so we were helping to plug lights and resistors into the FUZE box. This was challenging, because the wires of the electrical components bent every time you wanted to push a wire in.I found that holding the tip of the wire and then pushing it in worked. We then had to write the code to make the lights turn on at the right time. We had one person reading from the book, and one person typing. Because there were more than 2 people in the group, there were points that we weren’t doing anything. So we had to keep watching what was being typed.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that there were more than two people in our group limited my/ our learning, because when the lights were actually being plugged in, only one person could do it at a time. This left times that a few of us were doing nothing but watching. In a group of two this is already a problem, as one person is still left without anything to do, let alone a bigger group. This meant it was easier to get distracted.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will not get distracted when it is someone else's’ turn to plug lights in and write the code.
I won’t go around the whole room talking to people when it is not my turn. 
I will try to speed up my putting lights in, as it took me a very long time.
Make sure I swap who is doing what regularly.</td>
