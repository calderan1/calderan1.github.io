1.4 is binary and generating images with binary. The person who was reading out from the book was having to read a LOT of numbers, so my partner read them in a bingo voice. Strangely, this helped me  remember what numbers to type!? This got the code written quicker so that we could move on to the next thing quicker.

I need to get my Fuze box set up faster and save my work regularly so that I don't lose anything and don't leave it till the end and then struggle and not get it saved. Still work on not getting distracted but it got better. I also need to think about something myself before going to a classmate or a teacher straight away.
