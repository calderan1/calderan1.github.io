    <td>This lesson the whole class except me and Robert. The class was completing their Caesar cypher while me and robert were meant to be doing the same, only a whole new one but using binary. Robert had already completed this task at home, and he attempted explaining it to me. I sort of understood what he was saying to me. The part that I was slightly confused about was the ascii character part. I understand this part a bit more now, and I understand that you have to convert the message into a string of ascii characters and back again. but I could not work out how do code this into cells without help. So I decided to go around and help other people with their normal cypher. 

I went around people who were asking for my help. I tried to explain as well as I could, but people don't seem to want to know the method, so I ended up doing it for them. I think that I should make more attempt to make them interested to know the method.</td>
