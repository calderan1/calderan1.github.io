    <td>This lesson started with the class all at the front answering questions about how to code the encryption and decryption. I think I should have put my hand up to answer a few more of the questions, then when we broke away to do the work, I realised I had already finished the encrypting and decrypting, so I talked to Mr Tansley about what to do next. I sort of knew what I needed to do, but was confused about how to do it. So I tried to understand how to put the whole message into one cell and then use the split function. This Is what I couldn't do when I was coding for homework. 

Because I didn’t understand how to use the split function I went around the classroom and helped people get up to the point I had got to. I think that helping other people makes me understand the code I’m telling them to put in more. I went through the code methodically so that others could understand with me. Me and Robert were then set a challenge to convert the message into binary as the encryption and hen it go back to letter. This is a much more useful cypher than the Caesar cypher. This is because a computer is much more likely to want to use binary that letters. This sort o cypher would be used on making passwords secure or bank details. I think I could have at least tried to work out how to use the split function and at least tried to work out how to use binary, but I think I was useful to other people.</td>
