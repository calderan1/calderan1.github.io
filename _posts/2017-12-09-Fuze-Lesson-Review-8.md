  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found that instead of reading the book and the numbers of which  need to put lights in at, I look for the number and then count from the previous one to get the next one. I found that this was quicker than trying to read the badly taken pictures. When typing the code, I found that instead of looking back and forth from the from the computer screen, I got my partener to read everything including things like spaces, tabs and punctuation. This sped the typing up a lot. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was not reading the book properly, so this meant that I typed slower. Alos when my partner wasn't telling me where to plug lights in or telling me what to type I worked slowly too, because I had to keep referring back to the book. I need to ask my partner to read out where to plug things in and where to write code and what to wright. I also scooted around watching the people who were on to the robotic arm bit.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I won’t scoot around the room looking at what other groups are doing.
I will always ask my partner for help when I need it (always).
I won’t get distracted.</td>
