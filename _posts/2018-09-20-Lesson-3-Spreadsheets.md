    <td>This week in our lesson, we refreshed our memories on how to use the vlookup and the concatenate functions. After that we were set a challenge for most of the rest of the lesson. I found this challenge very difficult and even the beginning I found hard. The first step of the challenge was to enter the data on a seperate tab in sheets. I had to work out how to even do that first before I started to enter the data. When I started to input the data, I devised a method of inputting the alphabet which was very risky. Instead of doing the sensible of copying and pasting the alphabet and getting it right with no human error, I put every single letter in manually. This was not only extremely slow but when I found out that the layout of it was wrong, I was left behind with none of my data inputted and everyone else starting to code. But I persevered and got my data in before the end of the lesson. This meant I had time to do some of the coding, however I did what I could in the time, instead of checking that I knew how to code everything before I had to do the rest for homework. So this meant I was really stuck at home and couldn't work out how to do the coding part.

 I need to make sure I am listening in the demonstration and maybe even makes notes on how to do certain things. I also need to make sure I understand everything, before I start, instead of knowing just the first part and then being stuck for what to do later. I think I also need to ask more questions about the work.</td>
