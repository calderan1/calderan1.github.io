Once we had plugged our fuze box in, we started on 1.2 with variables and apples. We used the same method of one of us typing and on reading from the book and swapping after one block of code. When the apple situation got more complicated, we got a bit more confused, but we just kept on reading from the book only a bit slower. When we got to 1.3, with questions about name hobbies and age and later on favourite colour, it took us a lot of time to do not much code, however this was still the quickest method.

    <td>
I need to make sure that we are changing over the person that is typing regularly, because when there are long pieces of code to type up, having one person typing the whole thing isn't productive. I need to stop getting distracted and scooting around the room.
